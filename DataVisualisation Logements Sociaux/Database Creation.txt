##### AIMS OF THIS DOCUMENT #####
#################################

In order for this project to be reproducible, we listed here the information you'll need to be able to reproduce all the steps we did.
Since we use different tools, we considered having a didactic approach for our readers to understand the steps we made.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at :

### SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES :
To run correctly each part of this document, you'll need to install the following software :
R		RStudio			SQLite Studio		

### R PACKAGES NEEDED :
Please run RStudio, then run the following commands :
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
p_load(data.table)

We advise you to read carefully each part before running it.

######### FILES DOWNLOAD ########
#################################

First of all, you'll need to download the raw data files at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-des-logements-locatifs-des-bailleurs-sociaux/
Please download the files for years 2016, 2017 and 2018. Then extract each .zip file to a folder of your choice.

For demonstration purposes, we'll use the following folder : "C:/Users/[username]/Documents/R/DataVisualisation/"
Rename each extracted folder "Region2016", "Region2017" and "Region2018".

#################################
######### MERGING FILES #########
#################################

Now that we have downloaded the data and made sure they could be easily merged, please open the script "data_merge.R" and run it ("Ctrl+A", "Ctrl+Enter")
PLEASE NOTE : For this file to open, we'll consider each Region201X directory to be in the "~/R/DataVisualisation" directory of R (usually "C:/Users/[username]/Documents/R")

If the requirements specified above are met, you should see progression bars running, meaning that the files are successfully being merged.
If the bar seems stuck at some point, please do not try to interrupt the process as this may take a while (maybe about 15-20 minutes depending on your configuration). This usually happens when R has to parse a large file.
Our advice for better performance : Use this time to take a break, have a coffee, maybe read a book or play some guitar!
We also advise you to close any other programs running.

####### DATABASE CREATION #######
#################################

### This method uses data from 2018 for a demonstration.
### Please, create a table for each aggregated year data.

Create a folder named "C:/sqlite", and another one "C:/sqlite/datavis"
Copy each "data201X.csv" in the "datavis" folder

Download and Install SQLite Studio from https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt, then run SQLite Studio
First, you'll need to create the Database. Click on "Database/Add a Database" (or Ctrl+O)
Then, click the green circle with the "+" sign in it. Select the folder you want to create your database in (eg. "C:/sqlite/datavis") and enter the name of the database. Click on "OK". Give it a list name, then click on OK
Your database should now be visible in the menu on the left of SQLite Studio

Open the SQL Editor "Tools/SQL Editor" (or "Alt+E"), then double click on the "datavis" database
Click on "Tools/Import", then give a name to your table. For instance : "data2018" for the aggregated data from 2018.
Select the data2018.csv file. Choose the UTF-8 Encoding, and check the "First line represents CSV column names" box. Select "," as separator.
Click on "Finish". 
PLEASE NOTE : The import should take about 3 min per aggregated file.
