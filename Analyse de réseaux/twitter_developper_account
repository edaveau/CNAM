> I am Emmanuel Daveau, current student at the CNAM, which is a French Formation Institute. 
	I am doing a Masters in Data Science, and one of our courses is in Social Network Analysis. 
	For this course, we are required to retrieve data from Twitter in order to analyze them doing a graph analysis. 
	We might be asked to do more work with Twitter API later on, which is why I would appreciate you accepting my request.
> We would like to retrieve data from the hashtags related to roleplay, in order to see what user networks are built upon this theme. 
	Therefore, we will manipulate users pseudonames. In order to guarantee the safety and confidentiality of the users, 
	all the data obtained in this project will be strictly kept safely on our personal laptops. Furthermore, only the final results will be 
	present in the final assignment, and all the data will always be kept in a rigorously academic environment.
> Since we will collect data from this theme, one of our goals is to go beyond our assignment and create a temporary bot 
	which would post a few tweets related to roleplay. Once we will have showed the result, we will delete this bot.
> All content we will gather from Twitter will be displayed only in the context of our Masters. 
	Therefore, it will always be kept in a strictly private and academic environment.
